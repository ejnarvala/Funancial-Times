# Funancial Times

The Funancial Times is a news site built for the 21st century. In today's ridiculous economic and political climate, we strived to make a feed that could adequately describe current headlines.

## About
Built for HackMIT 2018, the Funancial Times is a financial events feed which lets you see headlines along with a Gif that relates to it.
Deployed to https://funancial-times.herokuapp.com, but non-working due to an expired Kensho API key.
